I work in a small IT company of less than 40 people. We have a bunch non-tech eployees mainly product owners, who are very active organization-wise within the company.
Most of the PO team are placed as consultants for clients of our company and those clients are most often enormous corporations of thousands of employees.

I want to take some time to talk about the clash of these two opposing mentalities: the one of a small sized familly-like startup and the burdened, old-school 
mastodon companies.

## When All You Have is SCRUM - Everything is an Agile Board

I am definetly not the first nor the last person that will judge SCRUM but I have to admin that there was a time when I was convinced that it was "the best methodoly" to push projects at a reasonable pace in production. But the more I worked in tech, the more it started to look like a fake "super tool" that people wanted to apply to any team and project and at any cost.

Your project is not advancing ? You are not applying scrum well ! You have extremely tight deadlines to respect ? More management is needed !
You want to reduce the costs of your project ? KPIs !!!

Applying a methodology (and not just talking about scrum) blindly without taking into consideration the maturity level of the team, the deadlines and not least the motivation of the team members is a very counter-productive thing to do.
An example comes to mind, where recently a colleague of mine was working alone on an internal application. He wanted to do a small demonstration of how things are going and invited some of the POs I meantioned earlier.

At the end of the demo, one of the young POs who decided to help with the product development started insisting we create a SCRUM board for tracking the tasks and the remaining work and so on. OK I said, let's create a shared text file and put some bullet points for what needs to be done next. But instead we got a Trello, where the lone developer would have to create, assign and update ticket statuses.
We are also talking about a person with almost 10 years of experience, who is serious enough to do his job, without having a manager to constantly remind him to update the time spent in the scrum board.

## The Bane of KPIs
This is also exarcerbated due to the fact that most SCRUM teams are driven by managers and not the tech teams.

One of the main reasons that management (I put POs in that bag too) is so obsessed with KPIs is that they need the visibility. But there is a catch 22 here. The more you ask your developers to fill in KPIs, the more your team is driven by these measurements, the more they will deviate from the truth.
Let me explain why.
At first KPI information will flow upstream from dev team to PO, to upper management all the way to steak holders. Things will be ok, pretty graphs will be shown on pretty presentations on large corporate meetings with nice quaterly projections.
A trend will be established, where we accept a given value of productivity, bugs and so on as "normal".

This trend will inevatibly start degrading as your project gets more and more complex, as bugs start arriving and as your architecture starts to shake under the high loads and so on.
This is when things start going souht. Management will start seeing "red flags" and will start pressuring the team to "fix" things and to "go faster".
And at this point we find ourselves in KPI driven development madness, where each developer tries as hard as possible to fulfull KPIs instead of doing proper engineering work. Tickets will be marked as "done" allthough the code was not even delivered. Best practices are thrown out of the window in order to go faster. Noone will like to take the hardest tasks in the backlog since in KPI hell 2 label changes > 1 important architectural change.

Legacy code will start to spiral out of control. Team motivation will go down. Turnover will cause invaluable loss of knowledge and project culture.
And I only have one question to managers - where is your KPI for these metrics ?

People will start overestimating tasks
