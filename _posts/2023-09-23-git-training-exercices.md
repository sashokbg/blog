# Git Training Exercises

I have worked with many junior team members over the past years and tried to help them get better at their job and also make sure the project we work on stays clean and neat. Sometimes I needed to explain architecture layering, sometimes Dependency Injection, other times code and framework specifics.

One thing however that kept coming each and every time was the problematic git usage. I found myself explaining how to properly use git and gitflow more often than any other topic.
Some of the worst thing 



An interesting thing to note is that I have started using version control systems such as CVS and SVN and I, as well as many colleagues at the time, had big problems with the mental model of Git and distributed VCS. This is why uI thought that nowadays junior members would be way better at using git since they didn't have to un-learn the bad practices they had.
Unfortunately this is only partially true.

Sometimes team members would do some so strange operation that even with 10 years of git experience I would struggle to fix or even understand what they did.
