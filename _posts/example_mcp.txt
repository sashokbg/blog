> You’re right — evaluating each check independently and parsing per-check results is the robust way to go. I’ve updated the evaluation flow accordingly.

  What I changed

  - Sequential execution + per-check markers:
      - web/src/model/operations/evaluate.operation.js
      - Runs a single compound script:
        - cd into the exercise repo once.
        - For each check: run in a subshell, capture rc, echo a sentinel line LG_EVAL_RC:<index>:<rc>.
      - Parses markers from the accumulated output buffer with a global regex, so split/chunked outputs don’t miss.
      - Fixes total/results sizing (now uses the checks length, not the wrapped command count).

  Why this fixes it

  - No short-circuiting or cross-check interference; each check runs and emits its own result.
  - Parsing from the accumulated buffer handles line-splitting across output chunks.
  - Verified in the browser: both checks in “Abort a merge” now show Passed.

  Notes

  - I also kept your checks UI improvements: it auto-expands on run and is styled to match Hints.
  - If you add more complex checks (pipes, grep, etc.), the rc capture remains accurate since each check runs in a subshell and we echo $rc right after it.

  Want me to add a tiny debug toggle to show raw LG_EVAL_RC lines during development? It’d help when authoring new checks.
